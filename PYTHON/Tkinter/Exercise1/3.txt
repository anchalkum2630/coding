Bhopal (/boʊˈpɑːl/; Hindi: [bʱoːpaːl] ⓘ) is the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and the administrative headquarters of both Bhopal district and Bhopal division.[10][11] It is known as the City of Lakes,[12] due to presence of various natural and artificial lakes near the city boundary. It is also one of the greenest cities in India.[13] It is the 16th largest city in India and 131st[14] in the world. After the formation of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal was part of the Sehore district. It was bifurcated in 1972 and a new district, Bhopal, was formed. Flourishing around 1707, the city was the capital of the former Bhopal State, a princely state of the British ruled by the Nawabs of Bhopal until India's independence in 1947.
